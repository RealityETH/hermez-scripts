Started the setup and tried sending funds

Edited contracts deploy test script to send funds to metamask address at 0x93aE36E02B15733E7b73895fAe2F5e26F8Acb3B0

Ran ssh forwarding script, added networks settings to metamask for test l1 and l2

Can see funds at
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_getBalance","params":["0x93aE36E02B15733E7b73895fAe2F5e26F8Acb3B0", "latest"],"id":1}' 127.0.0.1:8123
...and also in Metamask

Tried stopping and restarting
make stop
make restart

...this appears to clear out the previous state and start again (although metamask continues to show the balance)


Got contracts repo

# Issue with contract deployments:
# eg npx hardhat run deployment/2_deployPolygonZKEVMDeployer.js --network localhost
# fail silently after trying to downloading compiler
# This is some issue involving the solidity downloader which is giving up while trying to download and copy a file.
# Worked around it with 
# NB May need to create that directory
wget https://binaries.soliditylang.org/linux-amd64/list.json
cp list.json /home/ed/.cache/hardhat-nodejs/compilers-v2/linux-amd64/list.json



Broke geth out to our own version
Start it with our ./geth.sh
We can reset it with ./geth_purge.sh (just deletes data directories

Made a copy of zkevm-node/test to zkevm-node/ed to tinker with
Removed the line in the Makefile that called geth 
Ran amok with the docker-compose.yml removing anything that didn't look essential and replacing the docker :8545 connections with the docker ip address, 172.17.0.1

Created an imitation of the docker image in our local geth by following the steps found in 
docker/scripts/deploy-docker.sh

However this errors out when run because the test prover uses fork 4 so we need to change that in deployment/genesis.json
(This is probably the meaning of the branch name the image came from: zkevm-mock-l1-network hermeznetwork/geth-zkevm-contracts:v1.1.0-fork.4)

The script didn't seem to output the block number of the genesis block (ie where it mines polygonZkEVMContract)
Got this by connecting to our geth ( geth attach http://localhost:8545 ) and running things like
> web3.eth.getCode("0x610178dA211FEF7D417bC0e6FeD39F05609AD788", 32)

Other addresses should be as output by the deployment script, but check them against the output from the deploy script.
Updated parameters in the following files, not sure if all were needed:
ed/config/debug.node.config.toml 
ed/config/test.genesis.config.json 
ed/config/test.node.config.toml 
See myconfig.diff for specific differences


Seems to run ok like this
Ran the contract deployment test and it appeared to go


Backed up geth state to geth-deployed


What happens if we deploy the deployer twice? Probably can only happen once, the second time should be an invalid transaction (?) because of the way the keyless deploy works
