Started the setup and tried sending funds

Edited contracts deploy test script to send funds to metamask address at 0x93aE36E02B15733E7b73895fAe2F5e26F8Acb3B0

Ran ssh forwarding script, added networks settings to metamask for test l1 and l2

Can see funds at
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_getBalance","params":["0x93aE36E02B15733E7b73895fAe2F5e26F8Acb3B0", "latest"],"id":1}' 127.0.0.1:8123
...and also in Metamask

Tried stopping and restarting
make stop
make restart

...this appears to clear out the previous state and start again (although metamask continues to show the balance)
